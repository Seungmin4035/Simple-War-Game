# Simple-War-Game

I made a simple war game for second Java term project.
It's imitating ver simple version of war game.
You can pick position for worrior(sword master, archer etc), and have to protect your own king. 
This game is for two people! 

There are certain role about strength and movement for each class.
For this, please check "term_progect2.pdf" file. Thank you!
